The following workbook is a demonstration by example for using multiple linear regression in statsmodels & sklearn.
Non-linear models (quadratic and log-linear) are investigated and the log-linear model shows the best fit of all the linear & non-linear models
Finally, KNN machine learning & CART (decision tree regression models) are illustrated and compared to the other regressions
